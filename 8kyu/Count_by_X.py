DESCRIPTION:
Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples
count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]
"""

# My solution
def count_by(x, n):
    """
    Return a sequence of numbers counting by `x` `n` times.
    """
    return [i*x for i in range(1, n+1)]

    for num in range(1, n+1):
        result = x * num
        arr.append(result)
    return arr
